                <p>Wholesale e-commerce store's owner approached me with a quite simple project &mdash; implement Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce and a few additional events' tracking. But there were few things that made the project interesting:</p>
                
                <ul>                
                  <li>Custom coded CMS. As a cherry on top, comments and variable names were localized. Having Google Translate at hand, I had to dig deeper into CMS internals, understand how parts move and ensure my pieces of custom PHP and JavaScript code here and there would fit into CMS not breaking anything along with Enhanced Ecommerce setup.</li>
                
                  <li>High volume of different products. Since it's a wholesale store that operates with many SKUs on category pages, I've bumped into POST limit for sending data to dataLayer quite soon. Once again, I had to write some custom workaround code to send the data iteratively in batches.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a result, with Enhanced Ecommerce up and running, client now has better understanding of the store's performance and his clients' shopping behavior.</p>

                <p>At the time I first met that digital marketing agency, they already had a Google Data Studio dashboard to evaluate lead generating efforts broken down by marketing channel for a client of theirs. A simple table with common GA data, no big deal. The problem was they tried a few times to no success to extend the table with a single additional metric and were asking if I could help.</p>

                <p>What made the project challenging was that the requested metric was Assisted Conversions from GA Multi-Channel Funnel report. To make things a bit more fun, they had a custom channels grouping, but only inside GDS.</p>

                <p>To deliver the solution while having in mind all project limitations was quite an exciting task. Here's what I did:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>set up automatic pulls of Assisted Conversions into Google Sheets using a separate MCF API;</li>
                  <li>imported that sheet as a data source into GDS while applying unified custom channel grouping to both itself and GA source;</li>
                  <li>joined GA and MCF data by creating new blended data source;</li>
                  <li>extended the table with MCF Assisted Conversions metric which was linked with other marketing channels data from GA;</li>
                  <li>and finally, fixed table's summary row to overcome GDS issue when calculating totals from blended data sources.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The project was a success: added metric has led to a better, more holistic understanding of marketing channels performance.</p>

                <p>When the store's owner asked me of another favor we already had some history successfully straighten out initial sloppy analytics setup. Now, with the correct data flowing in, the owner wanted a convenient way to keep an eye on all KPIs of his property at once.</p>

                <p>After discussing his business goals and appropriate metrics to track, I've designed a prototype dashboard in Google Data Studio and showed it to the client. Few iterations later we agreed on a layout and exact metrics that should be rendered and I've moved on to the next phase &mdash; connecting client's data sources to a dashboard.</p>

                <p>As of implementation, there was a minor hiccup related to a 3rd party data connector, but other than that it went smooth. The most interesting part was to create 'Sales funnel' widget, having in mind GDS didn't have anything similar and I had to improvise. Nevertheless, the final result was even more informative and actionable than it was in the prototype.</p>

                <p>In the end, client was quite happy having all his metrics accessible in one place, so he could just give a quick look at the dashboard to get an idea of how his business going.</p>

                <p>How complex could be dividing two numbers and showing the difference? You might be thinking, even toddler should handle that. Well, when it comes to GDS, you may have to take a scenic route.</p>

                <p>A client of mine, he manages CRO business, needed a simple way of keeping his clients informed on the progress of optimization efforts. Clearly, a new way should be better that emailing monthly reports, so I came up with a pretty basic dashboard, showing how A\B tests are going in real-time. One of the metrics we agreed on was % delta (difference) between A and B variants' performance. But due to some GDS limitations I had to create the following workaround.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>First, I've set up scheduled pulls of data from Google Analytics into the Google Sheets, reference copied that data on a separate sheet and added delta calculations for a number of metrics.</li>

                  <li>With calculations handled I was able to import the sheet as a new data source in GDS and prettify it with formatting. So far so good.</li>

                  <li>Finally I could display delta on the dashboard. Hooray.</li>
                </ol>
